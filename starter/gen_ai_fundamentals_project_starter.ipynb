    "# Project: Teaching an LLM to Reason\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will teach an LLM to use step-by-step reasoning to answer the question: \"How many X's are there in the word Y?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting letters in a word is a surprisingly complex task for an LLM. Just as human beings would not be able to answer such a question for longer words without breaking down the word into its individual letters and then counting them, LLMs cannot be similarly expected to be able to respond without using smaller reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to count the number of o's in the word room, one could use the following reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question: How many of the letter \"o\" are there in the word \"room\"\n",
    "Answer: 2\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "<reasoning>\n",
    "Letter-by-letter spelling:\n",
    "1. r - 0 o's so far\n",
    "2. o - 1 o's so far\n",
    "3. o - 2 o's so far\n",
    "4. m - 2 o's so far\n",

    "The letter \"o\" appears 2 times in the word \"room\".\n",
    "</reasoning>\n",
    "<answer>\n",
    "2\n",
    "</answer>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will use the reinforcement learning method GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization, of DeepSeek fame) to take a large language model that has been fine-tuned for following instructions and teach it how to break a word down into its letters and then count the requested letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up the notebook\n",
    "* Create a letter-counting dataset\n",
    "* Create the reward functions\n",
    "* Train the model\n",
    "* View the results\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This notebook will have you focus on several important aspects of training a GPRO model using LoRA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configuring LoRA adapters for parameter-efficient fine tuning\n",
    "2. Selecting reward functions that help the model efficiently find its way to the correct answer (also called reward shaping)\n",
    "3. Finding hyperparameters that help the model increase the rewards earned more quickly and reliably\n",
    "4. Learning how to start with smaller experiments and to work your way up to longer experiments."
